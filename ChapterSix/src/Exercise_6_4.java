     * Give the method header for each of the following methods:
     * a) Method hypotenuse , which takes two double-precision, floating-point arguments side1 and side2 and returns a double-precision, floating-point result.
     * b) Method smallest , which takes three integers x , y and z and returns an integer.
     * c) Method instructions , which does not take any arguments and does not return a value.
     * [Note: Such methods are commonly used to display instructions to a user.]
     * d) Method intToFloat , which takes integer argument number and returns a float .******/
